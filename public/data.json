            "Hi, I’m Noel! I’ve been building web and mobile applications for over two years now, turning my love for coding that started in high school into a fulfilling career. I enjoy creating clean, functional digital solutions—sometimes to solve real world problems, and other times just to make something cool. It keeps things fun, makes them more interesting, and helps me keep learning.",
            "When I’m not coding, I’m either cycling, catching up on anime, diving into a good manga, or exploring new ways to stay active. These hobbies keep me inspired and balanced."
